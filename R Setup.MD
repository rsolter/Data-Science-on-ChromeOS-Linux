### R

**Base R & R Studio**

 1. Install basic R and development package `sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev`
 2. Download R Studio for [Ubuntu/Debian](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
 3. Install R Studio `sudo gdebi <rstudio deb file>`


**Installing packages in R:**
Among the packages [recommended by RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201057987-Quick-list-of-useful-R-packages), I installed the following:

    `install.packages("rvest","tidyverse","shiny","prophet","dtwclust","caret","WDI","leaflet","sf", "fields","RODBC","DBI","xlsx","Hmisc","zoo","devtools","jsonlite","rmarkdown","randomForest","multcomp","kableExtra","data.table","reshape","tm","plotly")`

_Ongoing issues with "prophet", "dtwclust"_
